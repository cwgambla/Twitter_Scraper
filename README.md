# Twitter_Scraper


I saw a youtube video on how to scrape data from twitter. I thought it would be cool if the program would be able to look at what is currently trending and grab a specified number of related tweets and their data for each trending topic. For example, if I specified 100 tweets per topic, the program would grab all of the trending topics, and for each topic, the first 100 related tweets for that topic would have their information scraped and recoreded into a .csv file.

#UPDATE 11/12/2022
Currently, the program will not work if you download it. I am in the process of switching over from the tweepy library to sncrape, since sncrape is suits the program's needs more. The program should be up and running by the end of December.
